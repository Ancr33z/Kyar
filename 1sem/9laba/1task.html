        <div class="gridElement2">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including
            layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility
            and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
            formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition
            in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
            pages that share the file and its formatting.
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
            than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME
            type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
            validation service for CSS documents.[5]

            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
            CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.
            Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7] Multiple selectors
            may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination
            thereof. The order of the selectors is important.
            Before CSS, nearly all presentationa l attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup.
            All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders, and sizes had to be explicitly described,
            often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style
            sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.
            Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings
            had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more
            complex,
