            The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents
            designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often
            assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for its appearance.
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and
            other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and
            directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide
            information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but
            use them to interpret the content of the page.
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
            structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
            appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between
            websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
            pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
